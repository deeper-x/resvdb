# Res VDB

A simple, in-memory vector database implemented in Rust for performing k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) search using cosine similarity.

## Overview

`VectorDB` is a lightweight Rust library designed to store high-dimensional vectors and perform efficient similarity searches. It uses a `HashMap` for in-memory storage and supports cosine similarity to find the `k` most similar vectors to a query vector. The implementation prioritizes simplicity and code quality, making it suitable for educational purposes, prototyping, or small-scale applications in machine learning and information retrieval.

This project emphasizes:
- **Simplicity**: Minimal design with clear, concise code.
- **Code Quality**: Well-documented with inline comments, docstrings, and comprehensive tests.
- **Rigorous Review**: Thorough testing and documentation to ensure reliability, addressing the need for high-quality code in AI-driven systems.

The library is ideal for applications like recommendation systems, semantic search, or any task requiring similarity search over vector embeddings.

## Features

- **Vector Storage**: Stores vectors with unique IDs in a `HashMap`, enforcing consistent dimensions.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Computes the cosine of the angle between vectors, ranging from -1.0 to 1.0.
- **k-NN Search**: Finds the `k` nearest neighbors to a query vector using a max-heap for efficiency.
- **Serialization**: Supports serialization/deserialization of vectors via `serde` for persistence.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Validates vector dimensions and handles edge cases (e.g., zero norms, invalid queries).
- **Comprehensive Tests**: Includes unit tests for all functionality, ensuring reliability.

## Installation

To use `VectorDB`, you need Rust installed. Add the following dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
```

Clone the repository or include the code in your project:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd vectordb
```

## Usage

The `VectorDB` library provides a simple API for creating a vector database, inserting vectors, and performing k-NN searches. Below is an example of how to use it, replicating the `main` function from the provided code.

### Example

```rust
use vectordb::VectorDB;

fn main() {
    // Create a new VectorDB with 2D vectors
    let dimension = 2;
    let mut db = VectorDB::new(dimension);

    // Insert sample vectors
    db.insert(1, vec![1.0, 2.0]).unwrap();
    db.insert(2, vec![2.1, 3.1]).unwrap();
    db.insert(3, vec![3.6, 4.1]).unwrap();
    db.insert(4, vec![6.7, 1.1]).unwrap();

    // Perform k-NN search with query [6.0, 1.0]
    let query = vec![6.0, 1.0];
    match db.knn_search(&query, 4) {
        Ok(results) => {
            for (id, similarity) in results {
                println!("ID: {} - Similarity: {}", id, similarity);
            }
        }
        Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
    }
}
```

**Expected Output**:
```
ID: 4 - Similarity: 0.99999696
ID: 3 - Similarity: 0.77435976
ID: 2 - Similarity: 0.68932617
ID: 1 - Similarity: 0.58817166
```

### Key Methods

- **`VectorDB::new(dimension: usize) -> Self`**: Creates a new database with the specified dimension.
- **`insert(id: u64, data: Vec<f32>) -> Result<(), String>`**: Inserts a vector with the given ID, validating its dimension.
- **`cosine_similarity(v1: &[f32], v2: &[f32]) -> f32`**: Computes the cosine similarity between two vectors.
- **`knn_search(query: &[f32], k: usize) -> Result<Vec<(u64, f32)>, String>`**: Finds the `k` nearest neighbors to the query vector, sorted by similarity in descending order.

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability. Tests cover:
- Initialization (`new`)
- Vector insertion (`insert`) with valid and invalid inputs
- Cosine similarity calculations (`cosine_similarity`) with edge cases
- k-NN search (`knn_search`) with various `k` values and invalid queries
- The main function’s behavior

Run the tests with:

```bash
cargo test
```

All tests pass, verifying the correctness of the implementation, including the k-NN search for the query `[6.0, 1.0]` which returns IDs `[4, 3, 2, 1]` with similarities `[~0.9999, ~0.7743, ~0.6893, ~0.5881]`.

## Visualization (Optional)

To visualize the vectors and their cosine similarities, you can add the `plotters` library to generate a 2D plot of the vectors as arrows from the origin. Add to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
plotters = "0.3"
```

Example plotting code is available in the repository (see previous discussions for details). Run the plotting code to generate `vector_plot.png`, which shows the query vector and stored vectors with their similarities.

## Limitations

- **In-Memory Storage**: Uses a `HashMap` for storage, which is not suitable for large-scale datasets.
- **Brute-Force Search**: The k-NN search has O(n) complexity, which can be slow for large numbers of vectors. For production use, consider indexing methods like HNSW or libraries like `faiss-rs`.
- **Single Similarity Metric**: Only supports cosine similarity. Future versions could add Euclidean distance or dot product.
